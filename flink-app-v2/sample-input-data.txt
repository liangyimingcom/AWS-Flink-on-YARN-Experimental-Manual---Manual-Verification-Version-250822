To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveler returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.

Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams.
Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
Here, we explain the important aspects of Flink's architecture.

Big data processing has become an essential part of modern applications.
Stream processing enables real-time analytics and decision making.
Batch processing handles large volumes of historical data efficiently.
Flink provides unified stream and batch processing capabilities.

The future of data processing lies in unified platforms that can handle both streaming and batch workloads seamlessly.
Real-time insights drive business value in today's competitive landscape.
Scalable architectures enable organizations to grow without technical constraints.
Open source technologies democratize access to advanced data processing capabilities.
